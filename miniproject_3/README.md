Parallelizing Matrix-Matrix Multiply Using Loop Parallelism

Once it has completed, you should see a score appear in the “Score” column of the “My submission” tab based on the following rubric:

    20% – correctness and performance of the parallel matrix multiply implementation on a 512x512 matrix using 2 cores
    30% – correctness and performance of the parallel matrix multiply implementation on a 512x512 matrix using 4 cores
    20% – correctness and performance of the parallel matrix multiply implementation on a 768x768 matrix using 2 cores
    30% – correctness and performance of the parallel matrix multiply implementation on a 768x768 matrix using 4 cores
