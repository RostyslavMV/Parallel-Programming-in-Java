Once it has completed, you should see a score appear in the “Score” column of the “My submission” tab based on the following rubric:

    10% - performance of the two-task parallel version on two cores processing 1,000,000 elements
    20% – performance of the two-task parallel version on two cores processing 100,000,000 elements
    20% – performance of the many-task parallel version on two cores processing 1,000,000 elements
    20% – performance of the many-task parallel version on two cores processing 100,000,000 elements
    30% – performance of the many-task parallel version on four cores processing 100,000,000 elements
