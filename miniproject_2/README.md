Analyzing Student Statistics Using Java Parallel Streams

Once it has completed, you should see a score appear in the “Score” column of the “My submission” tab based on the following rubric:

    10% – correctness of your averageAgeOfEnrolledStudentsParallelStream implementation
    10% – performance of your averageAgeOfEnrolledStudentsParallelStream implementation on 4 cores
    20% – correctness of your mostCommonFirstNameOfInactiveStudentsParallelStream implementation
    20% – performance of your mostCommonFirstNameOfInactiveStudentsParallelStream implementation on 4 cores
    20% – correctness of your countNumberOfFailedStudentsOlderThan20ParallelStream implementation
    20% – performance of your countNumberOfFailedStudentsOlderThan20ParallelStream implementation on 4 cores
